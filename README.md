# **My Arch Installation Script**

This is an Arch Install scipt I made. It installs a fully-functional Arch Linux installation
containing a desktop environment or a window manager with alot of extra packages (networking, bluetooth, audio etc.)
along with applications and utilities I use everyday. This Script has an automated and a guided manual version, if you want to learn and do it yourself with instructions and guidance. IMPORTANT NOTE: As of this moment, only the window manager installation with qtile will be configured, as it will be using my qtile dotfiles. The Gnome/KDE Plasma/Xfce won't have any customization out of the box!


## **IMPORTANT INFO**
**This installation script is not close to being finished, so don't use it yet!!**
